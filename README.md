## Motivation

I started working on this project for two reasons:

- I wanted to learn more about low-level programming and hardware
- A GameBoy Advanced emulator seemed like too much work 

Building this emulator met my expectations, and made me more comfortable with a number of things, like working with hex values, bitwise operations, and other bit-level manipulations. 

If you're interested in building your own Chip-8 emulator, the following were excellent resources for me:
